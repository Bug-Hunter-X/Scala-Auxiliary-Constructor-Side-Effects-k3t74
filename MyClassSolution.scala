```scala
class MyClass(val value: Int) {
  def this() = {
    this(0) //Explicitly call main constructor with default value
  }

  //Adding side effect for demonstration
  println(s"MyClass initialized with value: $value")
}
```

The solution clarifies how to handle auxiliary constructors properly, especially those that depend on the main constructor. The example illustrates how a simple explicit call to the main constructor is often the easiest and safest approach. This removes the ambiguity and ensures that the object state is correctly initialized, regardless of the main constructor's complexity.
