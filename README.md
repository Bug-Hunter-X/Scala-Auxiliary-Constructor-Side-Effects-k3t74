# Scala Auxiliary Constructor Side Effects

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Scala's auxiliary constructors when they interact with main constructors that have side effects or complex initialization logic. The example showcases how an incorrectly implemented auxiliary constructor can lead to unexpected or incorrect object states. This is important because it highlights a subtle and uncommon error in Scala programming, not immediately apparent to less experienced developers. Solutions are proposed to address this problem.
